# ForgottenKeep

Awish-Senpai's [ForgottenKeep](https://github.com/Awish-Senpai/ForgottenKeep) adapted for Replugged.

ForgottenKeep focuses on making the Discord's default dark theme, even more dark. This is pleasing to the eyes too. Redefined animations, colourful buttons and also some extra small animation touches everywhere, makes this theme unique from every other theme.

## Installation

Download [this file](https://github.com/DatGuy1/ForgottenKeep/releases/latest/download/dev.replugged.ForgottenKeep.asar) to `%APPDATA%\Roaming\replugged\themes`

## Troubleshooting

### Make sure Replugged is installed and running.

Open Discord settings and make sure the Replugged tab is there. If not,
[follow these instructions](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installation) to install
Replugged.

### Make sure the theme is installed.

Check the [theme folder](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installing-plugins-and-themes)
for your OS and make sure the theme is there. If not, make sure you have built the theme and that
the `NO_INSTALL` environment variable is not set.  
You can run `replugged.themes.list().then(console.log)` in the console to see a list of themes in
the theme folder.
